# A Context-Aware Speech Enhancement FPGA-SoC-Based Architecture
## introduction
Modern embedded systems have a complex structure and have application in many fields including aerospace, control, digital signal processing, etc. overcoming this complexity and optimal usage of the system resources is considered a challenge in most cases. Recent advancements in design tools and increasements in computational power of the implementation platforms have allowed these systems to move towards self-adaptivity which allows the system to adjust its behavior and priorities during runtime to meet design goals. context-aware systems are one of the types of adaptive systems that can adapt their operations according to the current system context. Utilizing context-awareness in embedded systems in middleware and hardware layers can save computational resources and improve quality metrics such as performance and reliability. FPGAs are suitable candidates for implementing such systems
