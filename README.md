# A Context-Aware Speech Enhancement FPGA-SoC-Based Architecture
## introduction
Modern embedded systems have a complex structure and have application in many fields including aerospace, control, digital signal processing, etc. overcoming this complexity and optimal usage of the system resources is considered a challenge in most cases. Recent advancements in design tools and increasements in computational power of the implementation platforms have allowed these systems to move towards self-adaptivity which allows the system to adjust its behavior and priorities during runtime to meet design goals. context-aware systems are one of the types of adaptive systems that can adapt their operations according to the current system context. Utilizing context-awareness in embedded systems in middleware and hardware layers can save computational resources and improve quality metrics such as performance and reliability. One of the prominent application fields for adaptive embedded systems is digital signal processing where the operating environment properties are time-varying. FPGAs are suitable candidates for implementing such systems because of features like runtime reconfigurability, parallel processing, and high internal bandwidth.
